# Backpropagation Algorithm

This is an implementation of  the backpropagation algorithm  using a simple neural network to solve the problems
*  OR
*  AND
*  XOR

A neural network with one hidden layer is used for predicting the results.To the run the program first run the required training script and load the relevant .mat file in the testing script and then run it.
